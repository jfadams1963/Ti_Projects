Ti Calculator Programs in TI89-BASIC and C. More TI BASIC programs will be added as time allows.  
&nbsp;  
The TI89 BASIC files here are plain text. They can be copy-and-pasted into a TI89-BASIC editor, or be converted into a TI-89 .89t file with a utility like these:  
https://jblevins.org/projects/ti89text/  
https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/347/34726.html  

Note the following replacements in these text files:  
+ the comment (copyright) symbol, &copy;, is replaced by '(c)',
+ the right arrow, &rarr;, used for variable assignment is replaced by '->',
+ the matrix transpose superscript is replaced by '^T'.
