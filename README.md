# Ti_Projects
Ti Calculator programs in TI-89 BASIC and C for the m68k based calculators: TI-89/Titanium, TI-92+, Voyage 200. And programs in Python for the TI nSpire CX II calculators.
&nbsp;

More TI-89 BASIC programs will be added as time allows.  
&nbsp;

The TI-89 BASIC files here are plain text. They can be copy-and-pasted into a TI89-BASIC editor, or be converted into a TI-89 .89t file with a utility like these:

https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/347/34726.html  

Note the following replacements in these text files:  
+ the comment (copyright) symbol, &copy;, is replaced by '(c)',
+ the right arrow, &rarr;, used for variable assignment is replaced by '->',
+ the matrix transpose superscript is replaced by '^T'.
