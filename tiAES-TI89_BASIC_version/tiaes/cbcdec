cbcdec(cs,w)
Prgm
(c) string, mat
(c) takes a cypher string and the key schedule

Local ps,i,sl,mb,tb

dim(cs)->sl
(c) empty plaintext string
""->ps

(c) get CBC initialization vector
subMat(w,rowDim(w)-3,1)->iv

For i,1,sl,32
	(c) encrypted bytes are represented by 2 hex digits
	(c) so we grab 32 cyphertext characters at a time
	(c) str_ord() coverts hex to dec
	str_ord(mid(cs,i,32))->st
	(c) copy state to a temp block
	st->tb
	decr(w)
	st xor iv->st
	ps&ord_char(st)->ps
	(c) temp block becomes the next IV
	tb->iv
EndFor

ps->out
EndPrgm
