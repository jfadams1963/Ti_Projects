# tiAES
AES for the TI-89  

This code is experimemntal and is not yet ready to be compiled with TIGCC.
It will first be beaten in to working whith the portable version before being
ported to the TI platform.  

It is a very simple (simple minded?) implementation of AES, but produces FIPS
compliant output. It is not suitable for real world usage, but only serves as
an educational excercise.
