# Brainfuck Interpreter in TI-89 BASIC

Here is yet another Brainfuck interpreter. Rather that explain the Brainfuck programming language and how to use it, I'll point you to the source:

Wikipedia has a good overview and history:

__About This Version__  

This version is based on the TI-89 code on Rosetta Code:

I had to make some corrections before making changes/additions.
